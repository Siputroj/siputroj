# Hi there, I'm Jason! 👋

I am a **Child of God** before anything else. Just as Jesus loved the world, I strive to lead with that same heart for others in both my professional and personal life. I am a "people first" developer who believes technology is at its best when it's making life easier for someone else.

Currently, I'm pursuing my **Master of Science in Computer Science** at Seattle University. With a background in **Biochemistry from UW**, I enjoy bridging the gap between complex science and smart automation.

### 🛠️ What I'm Building
* **Full-Stack Dev:** From co-founding **Investalk** (a social-fintech platform for Indonesia) to building digital handover systems.
* **Automation:** I've built genomic data pipelines that cut runtimes by 50% and created quality control systems for sequencing data.
* **Impact-Driven:** Whether it's a patient report summary page or a mobile-responsive UI, I build with the end-user in mind.

### 💻 My Toolkit
* **Languages:** Java, Python, R, C#, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
* **Frameworks/Tools:** React, ASP.NET MVC, Django, Bootstrap, Supabase, Linux

### 🤝 Beyond the Code
When I'm not at the keyboard, you can find me:
* Leading a **Connect Group** at [IFGF Seattle](https://www.ifgfseattle.org/).
* **Tutoring English** at Seattle University to help international students feel at home.
* Mentoring others and focusing on biblical-based personal development through community building.

I love hearing new stories and collaborating on projects that help people. Feel free to reach out!
