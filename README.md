# Hi there, I'm Jason! 👋

I’m a Computer Science graduate student at **Seattle University** who loves building things that actually help people. Before diving into tech, I studied Biochemistry🧪 at the **University of Washington**, and that background in science still shapes how I solve problems today—I’m always looking for ways to solve complex problems with automation🤖.

In my work, I’ve done everything from building medical reporting tools for researchers to implementing genomic data analysis pipeline and designing web applications. Ultimately, my goal is to make life a little easier for the person on the other side of the screen.

✝️ **My faith is at the center of everything I do**; I am a Child of God before anything else. Just as Jesus loved the world, I strive to lead with that same heart for others.

### 💻 My Toolkit
* **Languages:** Java, Python, R, C#, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
* **Frameworks/Tools:** React, React Native, ASP.NET MVC, Django, Bootstrap, Supabase, Linux

### 🤝 Beyond the Code
When I'm not at the keyboard, you can find me:
* Leading a **Connect Group** at [IFGF Seattle](https://www.ifgfseattle.org/).
* **Tutoring English** at Seattle University to help international students feel at home.
* Mentoring others and focusing on biblical-based personal development through community building.

I love hearing new stories and collaborating on projects that help people. Feel free to reach out!
