# Hi there, I'm Jason! 👋

I am a **Child of God** before anything else. Just as Jesus loved the world, I strive to lead with that same heart for others in both my professional and personal life. I am a "people first" developer who believes technology is at its best when it's making life easier for someone else.

[cite_start]Currently, I'm pursuing my **Master of Science in Computer Science** at Seattle University[cite: 6]. [cite_start]With a background in **Biochemistry from UW**[cite: 9], I enjoy bridging the gap between complex science and smart automation.

### 🛠️ What I'm Building
* [cite_start]**Full-Stack Dev:** From co-founding **Investalk** (a social-fintech platform for Indonesia) [cite: 30, 31] [cite_start]to building digital handover systems[cite: 18].
* [cite_start]**Automation:** I've built genomic data pipelines that cut runtimes by 50% [cite: 22] [cite_start]and created quality control systems for sequencing data[cite: 23].
* [cite_start]**Impact-Driven:** Whether it's a patient report summary page [cite: 13] [cite_start]or a mobile-responsive UI[cite: 14], I build with the end-user in mind.

### 💻 My Toolkit
* [cite_start]**Languages:** Java, Python, R, C#, JavaScript, HTML/CSS [cite: 44]
* [cite_start]**Frameworks/Tools:** React, ASP.NET MVC, Django, Bootstrap, Supabase, Linux [cite: 44]

### 🤝 Beyond the Code
When I'm not at the keyboard, you can find me:
* [cite_start]Leading a **Connect Group** at IFGF Seattle[cite: 39, 40].
* [cite_start]**Tutoring English** at Seattle University to help international students feel at home[cite: 35, 36].
* [cite_start]Mentoring others and focusing on personal development through community building[cite: 42].

I love hearing new stories and collaborating on projects that help people. Feel free to reach out!
